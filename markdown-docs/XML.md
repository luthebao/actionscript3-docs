The XML class contains methods and properties for working with XML objects. The XML class (along with the XMLList, Namespace, and QName classes) implements the powerful XML-handling standards defined in ECMAScript for XML (E4X) specification (ECMA-357 edition 2). 

Use the `toXMLString()` method to return a string representation of the XML object regardless of whether the XML object has simple content or complex content.

**Note** : The XML class (along with related classes) from ActionScript 2.0 has been renamed XMLDocument and moved into the flash.xml package. It is included in ActionScript 3.0 for backward compatibility.
