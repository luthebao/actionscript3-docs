# Conventions

This page explains the conventions used in the Adobe Flex 2 Language ReferenceActionScript 3.0 Language and Components Reference.

### Typographical conventions 

This reference uses the following typographical conventions:

  * _Italic font_ indicates a value that you replace with a specific value.
  * **Bold font** indicates language elements.
  * `Code font` indicates code snippets or language elements in the text.
  * In ActionScript, double forward slashes (//) precede comments.
  * In ActionScript, forward slashes and asterisks (/*... */) denote the beginning and end, respectively, of commented lines.
  * In MXML, the characters <!-- and --> denote the beginning and end of commented lines, respectively.
  * Numeric value ranges in code are represented as 0..59.

**Note:** In code examples, long lines of code may be broken for readability. If an error occurs when you copy and paste example code, verify that a long line of code does not contain a return.

### Presentation of class APIs

APIs are presented in typical API documentation format, but with the following modifications to help you better understand the ActionScript language:

  * The Package entry lists the package to which the class belongs.
  * The Class entry lists the class and its attributes.
  * Inheritance information shows the inheritance path and list inherited elements. Two types of arrow indicate inheritance: 
    * In the Inheritance entry at the top of the class description, a right-hand arrow points to the superclass that the class inherits from.
    * In the Public Properties and Public Methods sections, an upward arrow appears to the left of a property or method inherited from another class.
  * The Implements entry lists any interfaces that the class implements.
  * The Subclasses entry lists any classes that inherit from this class.
  * Constructors are listed as the first method in each Public Methods summary; thereafter, the methods are listed alphabetically.
