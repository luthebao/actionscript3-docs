# Package Detail

The flash.geom package contains geometry classes, such as points, rectangles and transformation matrixes, to support the BitmapData class and the bitmap caching feature.

Classes

| Class| Description  
---|---|---  
| [ColorTransform](ColorTransform.html)|  The ColorTransform class lets you adjust the color values in a display object.  
| [Matrix](Matrix.html)|  The Matrix class represents a transformation matrix that determines how to map points from one coordinate space to another.  
| [Matrix3D](Matrix3D.html)|  The Matrix3D class represents a transformation matrix that determines the position and orientation of a three-dimensional (3D) display object.  
| [Orientation3D](Orientation3D.html)|  The Orientation3D class is an enumeration of constant values for representing the orientation style of a Matrix3D object.  
| [PerspectiveProjection](PerspectiveProjection.html)|  The PerspectiveProjection class provides an easy way to assign or modify the perspective transformations of a display object and all of its children.  
| [Point](Point.html)|  The Point object represents a location in a two-dimensional coordinate system, where _x_ represents the horizontal axis and _y_ represents the vertical axis.  
| [Rectangle](Rectangle.html)|  A Rectangle object is an area defined by its position, as indicated by its top-left corner point (_x_ , _y_) and by its width and its height.  
| [Transform](Transform.html)|  The Transform class provides access to color adjustment properties and two- or three-dimensional transformation objects that can be applied to a display object.  
| [Utils3D](Utils3D.html)|  The Utils3D class contains static methods that simplify the implementation of certain three-dimensional matrix operations.  
| [Vector3D](Vector3D.html)|  The Vector3D class represents a point or a location in the three-dimensional space using the Cartesian coordinates x, y, and z.
