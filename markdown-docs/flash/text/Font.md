The Font class is used to manage embedded fonts in SWF files. Embedded fonts are represented as a subclass of the Font class. The Font class is currently useful only to find out information about embedded fonts; you cannot alter a font by using this class. You cannot use the Font class to load external fonts, or to create an instance of a Font object by itself. Use the Font class as an abstract base class.
