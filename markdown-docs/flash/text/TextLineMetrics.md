The TextLineMetrics class contains information about the text position and measurements of a _line of text_ within a text field. All measurements are in pixels. Objects of this class are returned by the `flash.text.TextField.getLineMetrics()` method. 

For measurements related to the text field containing the line of text (for example, the "Text Field height" measurement in the diagram), see flash.text.TextField. 

The following diagram indicates the points and measurements of a text field and the line of text the field contains:
