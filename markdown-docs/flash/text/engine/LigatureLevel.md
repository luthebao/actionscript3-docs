The LigatureLevel class is an enumeration of constant values used in setting the `ligatureLevel` property of the ElementFormat class. A ligature occurs where two or more letter-forms are joined as a single glyph. Ligatures usually replace consecutive characters sharing common components, such as the letter pairs 'fi', 'fl', or 'ae'. They are used with both Latin and Non-Latin character sets. 

**Note:** When working with Arabic or Syriac fonts, `ligatureLevel` must be set to MINIMUM or above.
