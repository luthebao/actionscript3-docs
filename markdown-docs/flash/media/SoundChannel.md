The SoundChannel class controls a sound in an application. Every sound is assigned to a sound channel, and the application can have multiple sound channels that are mixed together. The SoundChannel class contains a `stop()` method, properties for monitoring the amplitude (volume) of the channel, and a property for assigning a SoundTransform object to the channel.
