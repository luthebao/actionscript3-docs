The CubeTexture class represents a cube texture uploaded to a rendering context. 

Defines a cube map texture for use during rendering. Cube mapping is used for many rendering techniques, such as environment maps, skyboxes, and skylight illumination.

You cannot create a CubeTexture object directly; use the Context3D `createCubeTexture()` instead.
