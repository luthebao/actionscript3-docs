The NetStreamInfo class specifies the various Quality of Service (QOS) statistics and other information related to a NetStream object and the underlying streaming buffer for audio, video, and data. A NetStreamInfo object is returned in response to the `NetStream.info` call, which takes a snapshot of the current QOS state and provides the QOS statistics through the NetStreamInfo properties. 

**Note:** AIR 3.0 for iOS does not support any NetStreamInfo properties.
