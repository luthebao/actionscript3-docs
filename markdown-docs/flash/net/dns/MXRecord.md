The MXRecord class represents a Domain Name System (DNS) MX resource record containing a mail exchange server address. 

MX resource records are returned by a DNSResolver object as a result of a DNS lookup on a domain name. More than one record can be returned by a single lookup if more than one mail exchange is available.
