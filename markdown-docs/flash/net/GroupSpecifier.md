The GroupSpecifier class is used to construct the opaque `groupspec` strings that can be passed to NetStream and NetGroup constructors. A `groupspec` specifies an RTMFP Peer-to-Peer Group, including the capabilities, restrictions, and authorizations of the member using the `groupspec`. 

By default, all capabilities are disabled, and peer-to-peer connections are allowed.
