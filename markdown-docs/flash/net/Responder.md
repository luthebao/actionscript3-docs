The Responder class provides an object that is used in `NetConnection.call()` to handle return values from the server related to the success or failure of specific operations. When working with `NetConnection.call()`, you may encounter a network operation fault specific to the current operation or a fault related to the current connection status. Operation errors target the Responder object instead of the NetConnection object for easier error handling.
