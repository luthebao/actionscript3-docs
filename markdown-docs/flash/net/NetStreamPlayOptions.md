The NetStreamPlayOptions class specifies the various options that can be passed to the `NetStream.play2()` method. You pass a NetStreamPlayOptions object to `play2()`, and the properties of the class specify the various options. The primary use case for this class is to implement transitions between streams dynamically, either to switch to streams of different bit rates and sizes or to swap to different content in a playlist.
