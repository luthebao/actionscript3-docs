The XMLNode class represents the legacy XML object that was present in ActionScript 2.0 and that was renamed in ActionScript 3.0. In ActionScript 3.0, consider using the new top-level [XML](../../XML.html) class and related classes instead, which support E4X (ECMAScript for XML). The XMLNode class is present for backward compatibility.
