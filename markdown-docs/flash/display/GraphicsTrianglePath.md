Defines an ordered set of triangles that can be rendered using either (u,v) fill coordinates or a normal fill. Each triangle in the path is represented by three sets of (x, y) coordinates, each of which is one point of the triangle. 

The triangle vertices do not contain z coordinates and do not necessarily represent 3D faces. However a triangle path can be used to support the rendering of 3D geometry in a 2D space.
