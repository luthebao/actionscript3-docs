The Scene class includes properties for identifying the name, labels, and number of frames in a scene. A Scene object instance is created in Flash Professional, not by writing ActionScript code. The MovieClip class includes a `currentScene` property, which is a Scene object that identifies the scene in which the playhead is located in the timeline of the MovieClip instance. The `scenes` property of the MovieClip class is an array of Scene objects. Also, the `gotoAndPlay()` and `gotoAndStop()` methods of the MovieClip class use Scene objects as parameters.
