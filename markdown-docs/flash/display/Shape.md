This class is used to create lightweight shapes using the ActionScript drawing application program interface (API). The Shape class includes a `graphics` property, which lets you access methods from the Graphics class. 

The Sprite class also includes a `graphics`property, and it includes other features not available to the Shape class. For example, a Sprite object is a display object container, whereas a Shape object is not (and cannot contain child display objects). For this reason, Shape objects consume less memory than Sprite objects that contain the same graphics. However, a Sprite object supports user input events, while a Shape object does not.
