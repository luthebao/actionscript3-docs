The Graphics class contains a set of methods that you can use to create a vector shape. Display objects that support drawing include Sprite and Shape objects. Each of these classes includes a `graphics` property that is a Graphics object. The following are among those helper functions provided for ease of use: `drawRect()`, `drawRoundRect()`, `drawCircle()`, and `drawEllipse()`. 

You cannot create a Graphics object directly from ActionScript code. If you call `new Graphics()`, an exception is thrown.

The Graphics class is final; it cannot be subclassed.
