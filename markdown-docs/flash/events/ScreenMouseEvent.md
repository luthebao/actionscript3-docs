The SystemTrayIcon object dispatches events of type ScreenMouseEvent in response to mouse interaction. 

The ScreenMouseEvent object extends the MouseEvent class to provide two additional properties, `screenX` and `screenY`, that report the mouse coordinates in relation to the primary desktop screen rather than an application window or stage.
