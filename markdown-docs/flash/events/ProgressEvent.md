A ProgressEvent object is dispatched when a load operation has begun or a socket has received data. These events are usually generated when SWF files, images or data are loaded into an application. There are two types of progress events: `ProgressEvent.PROGRESS` and `ProgressEvent.SOCKET_DATA`. Additionally, in AIR ProgressEvent objects are dispatched when a data is sent to or from a child process using the NativeProcess class.
