A MouseEvent object is dispatched into the event flow whenever mouse events occur. A mouse event is usually generated by a user input device, such as a mouse or a trackball, that uses a pointer. 

When nested nodes are involved, mouse events target the deepest possible nested node that is visible in the display list. This node is called the _target node_. To have a target node's ancestor receive notification of a mouse event, use `EventDispatcher.addEventListener()` on the ancestor node with the `type` parameter set to the specific mouse event you want to detect.
