# Package Summary

The Flash Player API classes are in the flash.* packages. The Flash Player API refers to all packages, classes, functions, properties, constants, events, and errors that are in the flash package. They are unique to Flash Player, as opposed to the top-level classes, such as Date, Math, and XML, or the language elements, which are based on ECMAScript. The Flash Player API contains features that you expect to find in object-oriented programming languages, such as the flash.geom package for geometry classes, as well as features specific to the needs of rich Internet applications, such as the flash.filters package for expressiveness and the flash.net package for handling data transmission to and from a server.
