# Package Detail

This package includes classes used for network detection. The classes in this package are not defined in the runtime. This package is only available to content running in the AIR runtime. In a SWF-based application, you must include the ServiceMonitor.swc file in the compiler to access these classes. In an HTML-based application, you must load the ServiceMonitor.swf file (via a script tag) to access these classes.
